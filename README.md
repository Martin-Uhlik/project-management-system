# Project management system
A project management system that enables efficient workforce planning. It allows assigning employees and machines to specific tasks and setting their execution times. A key advantage is the visualization of task dependencies using a graph, making planning and coordination easier. At the same time, the system is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for less technically skilled users.
